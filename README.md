# chpythonz

## Disclaimer
BASED ON https://github.com/mdippery/chpython CHPYTHON (a tool like Chruby and base-on) to change python version between instalations using the python version manager called pythonz from https://github.com/saghul/pythonz

(all credits to * [mdippery](https://github.com/mdippery/), I just modified 10 lines.)

### Installing

do this on **GNU/Linux Debian** or **GNU/Linux Slackware**

```
sudo git clone https://github.com/RFGMM/chpythonz /usr/local/share/chpythonz/

```
and put his line on your .bashrc or .zhrc custom script savagery:

```
source /usr/local/share/chpythonz/chpythonz.sh

```
done.

The function's name stills 'chpython' so this is the usage:
